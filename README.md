# [Creative Little UI Kit](http://creativelittle.uk/uikit) (MK 1)

The Creative Little UI Kit is a performance focused, ITCSS based super scaleable front-end framework. It's built for the modern web and only supports modern browsers, that's right we've left IE9- out in the cold, all for the benefit of web users everywhere. It includes a flex based fluid grid, common, comprehendible Javascript plugins and a tasty minimalist style for all your friendly neighbourhood web elements.

## Requirements

This is a Sass based framework and you'll need something to compile all that sassy code. In-house we use [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit) to do all the checking, prefixing and minifying magic.

As mentioned above the prefixing is done with [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) which if you're using CodeKit is built right in.

## Setup

To get going with the framework you can:


  * Download the latest release
