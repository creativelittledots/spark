# <a href="http://creativelittle.uk/uikit" target="_blank">UI Kit</a> (MK 1)

The Creative Little UI Kit is a performance focused, ITCSS based super scaleable front-end framework. It's built for the modern web and only supports modern browsers, that's right we've left IE10- out in the cold, all for the benefit of web users everywhere.

The kit includes a flex based fluid grid, common comprehendible Javascript plugins and a tasty minimalist style for all your friendly neighbourhood web elements.

## Requirements

This is a Sass based framework and you'll need something to compile all that sassy code. In-house we use <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit" target="_blank">CodeKit</a> to do all the checking, prefixing and minifying magic.

As mentioned above the prefixing is done with <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" target="_blank">Autoprefixer</a> which if you're using CodeKit is built right in.

## Setup

To get going with the framework you can:


  * Download the latest release
